# TODO — codebase review findings (2026-07-06)

Full review of server.py, overlay.html, quickstart.py, setup_wizard.py, obs_setup.py,
scripts/, and CI. Work on `dev`; merge to `main` only once tested.

## Open — design warts (need a decision, not just a patch)

- [ ] **`/live` is a mutating GET consumed by two clients.** The control panel polls it
      every 3s/10s/15s, so it randomly eats buffered wicket events meant for the overlay
      (today only affects player-card timing) and runs the DB logger / event detection on
      every consumer's cadence. There's also a small append-vs-clear race on
      `_event_buffer` under the threaded server. Consider: only pop events for the overlay
      (e.g. `?consume=1`), or move panel polling to a read-only endpoint.
- [ ] **`obs_setup()` accepts `replay_folder` but never applies it to OBS** — quickstart
      passes it in and it's silently ignored. Setting it means touching the Simple-output
      FilePath (shared with recordings), so decide deliberately.
- [ ] **Importing server.py has side effects** — `scripts/check_panel_js.py` imports it to
      read CONTROL_HTML, and `_load_auth_config()` can *write* a generated control_token
      into config.ini during what should be a read-only syntax check. Guard the persist.
- [ ] **CONTROL_HTML is ~2,100 lines of the ~7,000-line server.py.** Consider extracting
      the panel to its own file served from disk (would also simplify the JS check and
      kill the backslash-escaping gotcha class). CLAUDE.md's "~5000 lines" note is stale.

## Features added on dev (2026-07-07)

- [x] **Match simulator** (`simulate_match.py`): rehearse the entire broadcast without a
      scorer. Scenarios full/chase/century/collapse, `--configure`, `--chaos` failure
      injection, deterministic per seed; 17 tests feed its frames through the real parser.

## Fixed on dev (2026-07-06) — verify live on Saturday before merging to main

- [x] **quickstart.py wiped panel-entered state on every run** (roster, sponsor fields,
      away colour, network-test cache, replay toggle edits; manual opposition when no
      fixture found). `build_state()` now merges over the existing file; match-day safety
      defaults (demo_mode/use_widget off) still forced.
- [x] **/live crashed on a non-numeric `home_club_id`** (set by the manual badge picker to
      a logo filename stem) — `int()` now guarded, falls back to 0.
- [x] **Weather was hardcoded to one ground** — `fetch_weather_data()` now prefers the
      `weather_lat`/`weather_lon` that `/match/fetch` saves; constants are fallback only.
- [x] **"Export CSV" 401'd when club_password was set** — panel now downloads via
      `apiFetch` + blob instead of `window.open` (which can't carry the Bearer header).
- [x] **Ball-event AI commentary trigger was dead** — `check_commentary_trigger` now runs
      *before* `buffer_pcs_events` advances `_prev_state`.
- [x] **Wicket events never buffered with commentary off** (found while fixing the above):
      `_prev_state` was only ever seeded inside the toggle-gated trigger, so with
      `graphics_commentary` off (the default) it stayed `None` all match — no wicket
      events, no fall-of-wickets in the match log. `buffer_pcs_events` now seeds it.
- [x] **Prematch "Scorer" never displayed** (overlay.html operator-precedence bug).
- [x] **`_persist_control_token` appended into the wrong section** when the
      `control_token =` line was missing — now inserts under `[Auth]`.
- [x] **`generate_social_graphic_facts` read `_match_log` unprotected** — both generators
      now share `match_log_snapshot_copy()`.
- [x] **Dead/duplicated `do_GET` routes removed** (GET `/commentary/over/generate` with its
      undefined `body`, GET `/commentary/test`, second `/pcs/debug`).
- [x] **Duplicate dict keys removed** (`drinks_over` in DEFAULT_STATE;
      `runsRequired`/`ballsRemaining` in `parse_pcs_json`, with the computed-from-target
      value folded in as a fallback).
- [x] **Duplicate DOM id `replay_enabled`** on the display-only centuries toggle removed.
- [x] Deleted `CLAUDE 2.md` (stale Finder duplicate of CLAUDE.md).
- [x] **Added an automated test suite** (`tests/`, stdlib unittest, ~80 tests, wired into
      CI which now also runs on `dev` pushes): parsing (ball tokens, PCS JSON incl. the
      innings latch, widget JSON), season-stats aggregation, session tokens + lockout,
      config token persistence, quickstart's state merge, JS↔Python classifyBall parity,
      and HTTP integration tests against a real in-process server (auth gating, secret
      redaction/sentinel round-trip, origin check, loopback carve-out, path traversal,
      and the /live PCS pipeline with event buffering + the ball-by-ball DB).
      Run: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
